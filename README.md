#### Dependency:
- theano and its dependency, eg. numpy, scipy
- gensim
- scikit-learn
- Need to download google word2vec pretrained model from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM and unzip it to data/ directory .

#### Data:
- files under raw directory is raw data
- other *.txt and *.p is generated by program.
- To generate training and testing data, run files under /data_process in the following order:
- Event_Classification: generate_train_test_data.py -> (generate_different_data_repr.py if you would like to compare different data represtation types ->) preprocess_data.py ->  word_embed.py
- Slot_Filling: generate_train_test_data_BIO.py (or generate_train_test_data.py) -> preprocess_data.py ->  word_embed.py

#### File Description :

##### Data Process
- preprocess_data.py: 
    - generate corpus based on train.txt and test.txt.
    - generated index for each word in the corpus
    - transform each word in the sentence to its corresponding index.
    - output file: corpus.p
- word_embed.py
    - use Google pretrained word2vec model, remember to update the path to pretrained model in this file
    - find word embedding vector for each word in the corpus.p file, if no vector is found, randomly generated a vector for that word
    - change word embedding mapping key from word to its index in corpus.p file
    - output file: word2vec.p (this word embedding model only contains words appear in corpus.p)
