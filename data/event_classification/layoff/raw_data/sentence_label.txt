64@3~^~What happened : Chrysler , which had been using Ignite for three years , decided to go with another agency .~^~O O O PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@4~^~`` The agency business is a rough one , and most of the income supports staff and labor , so we staff up as we win contracts and we have to typically let people go when we lose contracts , '' Tobin says .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O PERSON O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@5~^~And , while there 's new business in the pipeline -LRB- `` We 've got the largest pipeline of new business leads we 've had in company history '' -RRB- , it 's not enough to make up for the hole Chrysler is leaving .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O PERSON O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@6~^~So , Tobin had to draft a layoff plan .~^~O O PERSON O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@7~^~The layoffs : Employees were notified July 24 , a day after the contract was terminated , that trouble was brewing .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~layoff~^~past_Layoff

64@12~^~`` We decided to guarantee that success to other employers , '' he says .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A

64@14~^~And it appears to be working .~^~O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@15~^~He says some laid-off staffers , a group that consists of varied tenures of employees , already have new jobs .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@16~^~And several employers have reached out to Tobin personally .~^~O O O O O O O PERSON O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@17~^~`` We 're also giving our people as much vacation time as they need to take to do interviews , '' he says .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A

64@21~^~He does have advice , however , for other leaders facing layoff inevitabilities .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@22~^~Most of his advice boils down to honesty .~^~O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@23~^~`` Be candid with your employees , '' he says .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@24~^~`` They know what 's true and what 's not true , so trying to be coy or clever is not the way to go .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
64@25~^~I think it burns you in the end . ''~^~O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A

111@12~^~I will not shut out the lessons that they teach ! ''~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@14~^~Most CEOs learn from the past and celebrate the wins in the present .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@15~^~But the best CEOs make decisions and set priorities based on what they believe will happen in the future .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@16~^~As a leader it 's your duty to make sense of company mandates for your employees .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@17~^~Delivering difficult messages about cost cutting during the Christmas season is not easy .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@18~^~So before you communicate to your team about the cuts , take the time to understand why they are being directed , and what should be said .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@19~^~Assuming your CEO is competent -LRB- and not an unredeemed Scrooge -RRB- , several reasons would justify the cost-cutting : Markets : The market may be declining in size .~^~O O TITLE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@20~^~While employees tend to measure their performance against the prior year , top CEOs measure performance against the market potential in the future and the capacity of their organization to respond to it .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@21~^~Depending on the investment time horizon , excess capacity must either be absorbed through growth or cut to avoid lower profits or losses .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@22~^~For example , after several years of growth , analysts expect the mortgage market to decline next year due to a combination of factors , such as rising interest rates and flat wage growth. , Expenses : Perhaps free cash is being spent , rather than invested .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@23~^~When businesses are making money , managers have a tendency to spend the profits on non-value added projects or activities that do not provide a return above the risk level of the business. , Value : Valuation may be an issue .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@24~^~The board of directors may be putting the business up for sale at its peak value .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@25~^~To maximize value further , every dollar saved generates a multiplier on the value of the business. , Investments : There may be a better way to use or invest the company 's profits .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@26~^~Possibly your business is treated as a cash cow and is being milked for all of its profits to be deployed elsewhere .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@28~^~These are all generally good reasons for cutting costs .~^~O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@29~^~There are also bad reasons for cutting costs .~^~O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@30~^~Your CEO may have failed to define a clear and compelling direction for the organization 's future to shareholders .~^~ORGANIZATION TITLE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@31~^~In this situation , a competent board of directors identifies the lack of vibrant leadership as a sign of coasting on the past and status-quo thinking .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@32~^~Thus , a short-term focus on cutting costs is invoked to shake things up , reveal hidden waste and stay competitive .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@33~^~Or your CEO may be risk averse , unable to see future opportunities beyond the success of the current year .~^~O O TITLE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@34~^~Cost cutting sometimes comes out of a miserly view that sees the present success as unlikely to continue .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@35~^~Unfortunately , cutting costs often includes reducing staff .~^~O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
111@36~^~Nobody likes doing a layoff before Christmas .~^~O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A

111@38~^~But the alternative of waiting to communicate these decisions -LRB- which are beyond your control -RRB- until after the holidays often makes things worse for the affected employees and their families .~^~O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O~^~n/a~^~N/A
